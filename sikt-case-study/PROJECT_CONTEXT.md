# SIKT Case Study - Project Context

## About SIKT
SIKT (Senter for IKT i utdanningen) is the Norwegian IT developer for the Norwegian educational sector. As a central organization, SIKT provides IT services, infrastructure, and solutions to educational institutions across Norway.

## Case Study Purpose
This case study documents SIKT's journey from a traditional hierarchical organization to an agile, product-oriented structure. It serves as a practical example for other organizations considering similar transformations, particularly those in the public sector or education technology space.

## Target Audience
- Organizational leaders considering agile transformation
- Change management professionals
- Public sector IT organizations
- Educational technology leaders
- Students of organizational design

## Key Transformation Topics

### 1. Timeline-Based Narrative
- **Pre-transformation**: Traditional government IT organization structure
- **Catalyst**: Need for increased responsiveness to educational sector needs
- **Journey**: Phased approach to organizational redesign
- **Current state**: Product-oriented, agile organization

### 2. From Traditional to Product Groups
- Identifying SIKT's "products" in educational services context
- Defining clear boundaries around service offerings
- Mapping value streams for each product
- Reorganizing teams around products rather than functions

### 3. Strategic Focus Evolution
- Shift from operations-centric (reliability, standardization)
- To customer-centric (educational institution needs)
- Balancing stability requirements with innovation needs
- Aligning metrics with new strategic focus

### 4. Organizational Design Changes
- Decoupling dependencies between units
- Pushing decision-making closer to teams
- Implementing clear product ownership
- Separating product management from people management

### 5. Building Cross-functional Teams
- Breaking down silos between development, operations, and support
- Implementing multi-skill development programs
- Creating communities of practice
- Fostering T-shaped professionals

### 6. Shared Services Design
- Determining what stays centralized (infrastructure, security)
- What moves to product teams (development, customer support)
- Creating enabling services rather than gatekeepers
- Maintaining efficiency while increasing autonomy

### 7. Outcomes and Continuous Evolution
- Improved response time to educational sector needs
- Increased employee engagement and satisfaction
- Better alignment between IT services and educational outcomes
- Ongoing adaptations and learning

## Case Study Approach
Following the Creating Agile Organizations (CAO) framework by Cesario Ramos, this case study will:
- Use real-world examples from SIKT's transformation
